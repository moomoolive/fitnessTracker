# Fitty

A free and open-source fitness web-app, with a very unoriginal name.

All source code is found in the "code" folder.

Built with Next.js (Typescript) and Actix-Web (Rust).

This application intends to ONLY implement a couple of features:
* An easy interface to enter data on individual workouts
* Intuitive tools that visualize monthly/weekly progress
